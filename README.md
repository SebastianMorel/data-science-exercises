Normal Distribution:

Analyze the normal distribution using provided lap times data.
Implement the task in Python, addressing all questions without manual sketches.
Present results with appropriate graphs and interpretations.
Central Limit Theorem (CLT):

Implement exercises related to CLT in Python.
Answer all associated questions, focusing on demonstrating how sample distributions approximate normality as the sample size increases.
Melbourne Real-Estate Dataset Exploration:

Perform three creative data analysis tasks beyond simple statistics like mean and standard deviation. Examples include:
Analyzing the relationship between the distance from the CBD and property prices.
Investigating house sizes versus prices.
Examining suburbs by the number of properties and their price distributions.
Analyzing home construction trends by years and councils.
Exploring price points and house sizes across regions or sellers.
Present findings with relevant plots and detailed explanations.
## Part B: Gradient Descent Algorithm (GDA)
The focus is to understand and implement gradient descent for optimizing parameters in a linear model, using the Melbourne Real-Estate Dataset.

Linear Regression Model:

Use a simple linear regression model ùë¶=ùëöùë•+ùëê where ùëö is the slope and ùëê is the intercept.
Analyze the relationship between the number of bedrooms and property prices for a specific suburb (e.g., Caulfield North) and visualize it.
Gradient Descent Implementation:

Implement GDA in Python to optimize ùëö and ùëê.
Explore:
The effect of different learning rates on convergence and parameter values.
The cost function behavior during optimization.
Visualization:

Plot the relationship between bedrooms and prices using the optimized model.
Include graphs showing the best-fit line and learning rate effects.
